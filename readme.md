## Reflection 

This assignment helped me get a practial knowledge on how collaborative development works on GitHUb. By creatiing separate branches for each issue and trying to solving the issues and the commiting the changes and using pull request and then finally merge working code to the main branch. I learned how we can track our work is easy using GitHub maintaining a clean workflow using version control.

Understanding the FastAPI helped me better improve my backend skills, like creating custome validators for username, passwords and profile image URLs. And also gained much new things when creating the CI/CD pipelines using GitHub actioons and Docker. Writing test cases for pytest and trying to iprove the coverage to 97% really helped me gain extra knowledge on how the test cases works and understood how to write, test and re-write too.
